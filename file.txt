I have listed some tools that can be used for searching and extracting web content. Here are two tools:

1. **tavily-search**: A powerful web search tool that provides comprehensive, real-time results using Tavily's AI search engine. It allows customization of result count, content type, and domain filtering.

2. **tavily-extract**: A tool for retrieving and processing raw content from specified URLs. This is useful for data collection, content analysis, and research tasks.

Would you like to use one of these tools or need more information on how they work?
